# Motivation for the main technology choices

<details>

<summary>Java</summary>

For being a robust, reliable language that provides a rich ecosystem of integrated library functions

<details>

<summary>Springboot</summary>

For being a tool that facilitates and speeds up the development of web applications and microservices

</details>

<details>

<summary>Maven</summary>

Because it has a mature ecosystem and a large number of ready-to-use plugins, which makes it easy to integrate with many other tools and libraries.

<details>

<summary>Postgres</summary>

For having good performance, and because I have more familiarity
